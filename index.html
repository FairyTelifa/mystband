      <h1>NEW ALBUM DROP</h1>
      <p>
        This will be their first ever album. The theme of this album will be
        about their title song "Without." The song gives the story of a woman
        who is dealing with despair and hopelessness coming from a loss. We have
        not been informed what the loss is as they want it to be a suprise until
        you listen to the song. But by the end of the song, she will embrace the
        despair that she is feeling and will hopefully regain her will to live
        or see the light that she saw as a child.
